Absolutely 💪 — here’s a well-structured list of popular LLD (Low-Level Design) problems that are interview favorites (especially for backend or SDE-2 roles like you’re targeting 👇):

🧠 Core LLD Problems (must-do)

LRU Cache
→ Learn use of HashMap + Doubly Linked List.
(LeetCode #146)

Parking Lot System
→ Design multi-level parking lot with slots, vehicles, and tickets.

BookMyShow / Movie Ticket Booking System
→ Seat allocation, show management, payments.

Logger Rate Limiter / Rate Limiter
→ Control frequency of API calls using timestamps.

Cache Systems (LRU, LFU, FIFO)
→ Explore eviction policies and optimizations.

Elevator System (Lift System)
→ Handle requests going up/down, direction logic.

Design a Key-Value Store (like Redis mini)
→ TTL expiry, persistence options, concurrency.

Splitwise
→ Manage group expenses, balance sheets, and settlements.

Snake and Ladder / Tic Tac Toe / Chess Game Engine
→ Good for OOP & state design.

Library Management System
→ Book inventory, members, borrow/return.

🌐 Backend / Distributed Systems Oriented

URL Shortener (like TinyURL)
→ Base62 encoding, hash collision handling, DB mapping.

Notification Service (Email/SMS/Push)
→ Queues, retry mechanism, async delivery.

Pub-Sub System (like Kafka mini)
→ Topics, producers, consumers, message delivery.

File Storage System (Google Drive / Dropbox)
→ Hierarchical folders, sharing, and metadata.

Logging Framework
→ Multiple appenders (console, file), levels (INFO, ERROR).

Rate Limiting using Token Bucket / Leaky Bucket Algorithm

Design a Chat System (like WhatsApp)
→ Users, groups, messages, delivery & storage (you already built this 💥).

Design a Netflix-like Video Streaming System
→ CDN concept, transcoding, caching layers (your current project 🔥).

💸 Finance / Business-Oriented

ATM System
→ Handle multiple denominations, withdrawal logic.

Vending Machine
→ Item selection, payment, change management.

Payment Gateway (like Razorpay/Stripe)
→ Transactions, idempotency, retries, callbacks.

Trading System / Stock Exchange
→ Order matching engine (Buy/Sell book).

🧩 Moderate to Advanced LLDs

Rate Limiter with Redis Backend

Search Autocomplete System (Trie-based)

Document Collaboration (like Google Docs)

Leaderboard System (like LeetCode ranks)

Quiz App / Online Exam System

Ride Sharing (Uber/Ola) — Matching algorithm, dynamic pricing.

Notification Scheduler (Cron-like system)

Content Delivery Network (mini CDN)

⚙️ Patterns to Practice

Singleton, Factory, Strategy, Observer, Builder, Proxy

Thread-safe design (for cache, queue, etc.)

Immutability and concurrency control

Would you like me to give a 7-day practice roadmap for these (e.g., 2 LLDs/day in increasing order of difficulty, with hints + design diagrams)?
It’ll help you prepare systematically like an SDE-2 interview plan.
